# text-generator-sagemaker
In this project, we aim to build a text generator model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) suitable for sequence prediction problems. The model will be trained on a dataset of Amazon food reviews, focusing on generating text that mimics the style and content of these reviews
